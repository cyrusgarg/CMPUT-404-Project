Identity tasks: 

- As an author, I want a consistent identity per node, so that URLs to me/my posts are predictable and don't stop working.

- As a node admin, I want to host multiple authors on my node, so I can have a friendly online community.

- As an author, I want a public page with my profile information, so that I can link people to it.

- As an author, I want to my (new, public) GitHub activity to be automatically turned into public posts, so everyone can see my GitHub activity too.

- As an author, I want my profile page to show my public posts (most recent first), so they can decide if they want to follow me.
